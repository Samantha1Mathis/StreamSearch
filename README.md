Project Title: StreamSearch

Project Description: A website for users to login and generate a movie suggestion based upon selected streaming service, genre and year released choices.

Functionality: Users will be required to register and login using an email address and password, users can change search choices regarding streaming service, 
genre and year released, generate movie suggestions and link the user directly to the movie on the given streaming service site. 

Description: Users can select between the following streaming services: Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, or all services. Genre choices include Action/Adventure, 
Comedy, Drama, Romance, Horror, Family or all genres. Users can select the year the movie was released from the following timeframes:
1960>, 1960-1980, 1980-2000, 2000-2010, 2010<, or any year. 
After selecting the previous choices, the search will generate a movie suggestion which will provide the movie and external link to take the user to the movie on the streaming site. 
The layout will be user-friendly and easy to navigate by allowing the user to select a variety of search combinations and redirect the user to the movie on the streaming service.                                                                                                          Things the project will include outside of user interaction:                                                                         Movie picture, title and link to streaming service.

Additional Login Benefits: The ability to search for a movie suggestion as well as navigate to the external streaming service with the click of a button will be disabled if the user is not logged in. 
If not logged in, the user will not be able to input search choices and will only see the list of all the movies.
